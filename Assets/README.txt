Game 3: Top-Down Game
This game is a remake of my favorite game the Binding of Isaac. Player need to control the character and shoot bullet to kill enemies.
Player can use WSAD for character movement and mouse for shooting bullet. Player can also use Up/Down/Left/Right button to shoot bullet.
Enemies come in waves and the game will only reach next wave after defeating all the enemies. There will be two seconds break between waves.
Every four waves, the player will enter the next stage and one power up item will be spawned:
Magic Mushroom: increase all the stats of the player
Mom Eye: increase the chance of shooting another bullet at the back
The game will continue only after player picks up the power up item.
All enemies are randomly spawned and there will be more and more enemies after stage increases.
After defeating one enemy, there is a 10% chance to drop a heart to heal the hp or a coin to increase the score.
The mode is endless and the goal is to get the highest score as you can.

Game 4: Side Scroller Game
This game is a side scrolling game with remake of similar player controller from Celeste.
Player needs to control the charater to surive for as long as they can while avoiding the traps.
Player can use WSAD for character movement, Space/C for Jumping, J/X for dashing. The dashing direction is depended on the movement control keys.
When player are dashing, they are invulnerable to the spikes, which allows them to dash through the verticle spike walls.
The level is made up of three layers of platforms, and are generated from the algorithm.
The game difficulties while also increase along with the increase of score. The scrolling speed will be faster,
and there will be a greater chance for spawning a spike platform. However, there will always spawn at least one safe platform for every waves of platforms.
Player has three lives and can pick up heart to heal up to five lives.
There are also some special techniques that allow player to jump with faster speed:
Dash horizontally on the ground and jump before dash end will trigger dash jump, providing a boost in horitonal speed and refreshing the dashing count
Dash to the wall and jump after touching the wall will trigger wall jump, providing a boost in vertical speed.
